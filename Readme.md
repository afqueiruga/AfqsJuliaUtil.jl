# afq's julia utils

Alejandro Queiruga

Just a little collection of utility functions for Julia.
I'm interested in ML and metaprogramming, so there'll be utilites for generating
and manipulating expressions.
This repository is more of a dump of snippets than a module;
feel free to copy-and-paste solutions out of it.
They'll be heavily editted continuously.
